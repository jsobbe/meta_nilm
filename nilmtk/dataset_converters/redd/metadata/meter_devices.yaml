  description: >
    Measures circuit-level power demand.  Comes with 24 CTs.
    This FAQ page suggests the eMonitor measures real (active)
    power: http://www.energycircle.com/node/14103  although the REDD
    readme.txt says all channels record apparent power.
  sample_period: 3   # the interval between samples. In seconds.
  max_sample_period: 50   # Max allowable interval between samples. Seconds.
  measurements:
  - physical_quantity: power   # power, voltage, energy, current?
    type: active   # active (real power), reactive or apparent?
    upper_limit: 5000
    lower_limit: 0
  wireless: false

REDD_whole_house:
  description: >
    REDD's DIY power meter used to measure whole-home AC waveforms
    at high frequency.  To quote from their paper: "CTs from TED
    (http://www.theenergydetective.com) to measure current in the
    power mains, a Pico TA041 oscilloscope probe
    (http://www.picotechnologies.com) to measure voltage for one of
    the two phases in the home, and a National Instruments NI-9239
    analog to digital converter to transform both these analog
    signals to digital readings. This A/D converter has 24 bit
    resolution with noise of approximately 70 µV, which determines
    the noise level of our current and voltage readings: the TED CTs
    are rated for 200 amp circuits and a maximum of 3 volts, so we
    are able to differentiate between currents of approximately
    ((200))(70 × 10−6)/(3) = 4.66mA, corresponding to power changes
    of about 0.5 watts. Similarly, since we use a 1:100 voltage
    stepdown in the oscilloscope probe, we can detect voltage
    differences of about 7mV."
